# An API client for Edgescan

---

## Overview

### Edgescan

[Edgescan](https://www.edgescan.com/) is a vulnerability management solution that allows you to identify both network and application layer vulnerabilities across a wide variety of systems.

### Data model

![Edgescan's data model](resources/images/edgescan-data-model.png)

Edgescan's data model includes:
- **Assets**: define which _hosts_ to scan for _vulnerabilities_;
- **Hosts**: represent individual computer systems (physical or virtual); and 
- **Vulnerabilities**: represent known attack vectors that may be exploited by an adversary.

### Caveats

- Since hosts and vulnerabilities are linked by location (i.e. by IP address or hostname) rather than using stronger factors such as UUIDs, any two hosts that have the same IP address or hostname will have the same vulnerabilities.

---

## API client

This API client is written in Python and includes a command line interface that you can use to list, count, and retrieve objects.

### Features

You can use this package to:

- List, count, and retrieve assets, hosts, licenses, and vulnerabilities; and
- Export data from Edgescan in JSONL format

### Disclaimers

- This package is not maintained by, or supported by Edgescan.

### Warnings

- The latest version of all hosts, licenses, and vulnerabilities will be written to the system's temporary directory by default <sub>1</sub>.

<sub>1. You can disable this behaviour by setting `EDGESCAN_ENABLE_CACHE=false`</sub>

### Installation

To install the `edgescan-api-client` (requires [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/whitfieldsdad/edgescan-api-client.git
$ cd edgescan-api-client

### Testing

To run the unit tests and integration tests:

```shell

```

#### Code coverage

Code coverage reports will automatically be created in two different formats:
- HTML: `coverage/html/index.html`
- JSON: `coverage/json/coverage.json`

To read the HTML-formatted code coverage report:

```shell
$ open coverage/html/index.html
```

To read the JSON-formatted code coverage report:

```shell
$ cat coverage/json/coverage.json | jq
```

#### Python

##### Search for assets

To look up all assets and list their names:

```python
from edgescan import Client

api = Client()
assets = api.iter_assets()

names = {asset['name'] for asset in assets}
print(', '.join(sorted(names)))
```

##### Search for hosts

To look up all active hosts and list their locations (i.e. IP addresses and hostnames):

```python
from edgescan import Client

api = Client()
locations = set()
for host in api.iter_hosts(alive=True):
    locations |= {host['location']} | set(host['hostnames'])

print(', '.join(sorted(locations)))
```

To look up all active hosts and their OS versions:

```python
from edgescan import Client

api = Client()
os_versions = {host['os_name'] for host in api.iter_hosts(alive=True) if host['os_name']}
print(', '.join(sorted(os_versions)))
```

To count active hosts by OS type and OS version:

```python
from edgescan import Client
from collections import OrderedDict

import edgescan.platforms
import collections
import json

api = Client()

tally = collections.defaultdict(lambda: collections.defaultdict(int))
for host in api.iter_hosts(alive=True):
    os_version = host['os_name']
    if os_version:
        os_type = edgescan.platforms.parse_os_type(os_version)
        tally[os_type][os_version] += 1

#: Sort by rate of occurrence.
tally = OrderedDict(sorted(tally.items(), key=lambda e: e[1], reverse=True))
print(json.dumps(tally, indent=4))
```

##### Search for licenses

To search for licenses and list their names:

```python
from edgescan import Client

api = Client()
names = {row['name'] for row in api.iter_licenses()}
print(', '.join(sorted(names)))
```

##### Search for vulnerabilities

To count vulnerabilities on active hosts:

```python
from edgescan import Client

api = Client()
total = api.count_vulnerabilities(host_is_alive=True)
print(total)
```

To count vulnerabilities on active hosts by CVE ID:

```python
from edgescan import Client
from collections import OrderedDict

import collections
import json

api = Client()

tally = collections.defaultdict(int)
for vulnerability in api.iter_vulnerabilities(host_is_alive=True):
    for cve_id in vulnerability['cves']:
        tally[cve_id] += 1

#: Sort by rate of occurrence.
tally = OrderedDict(sorted(tally.items(), key=lambda e: e[1], reverse=True))
print(json.dumps(tally, indent=4))
```
